            Ration Incâ€™s mission is to prevent and reduce household food waste among consumers using smart technologies and powerful data.  
             We believe that instead of rejecting modern advancements, we can use our innovations to pave a sustainable future for both the earth and the human race.

                <p class = "tagline"> We at Ration have identified a problem with food waste, specifically, household food waste. 
                    It is a common experience to go grocery shopping, and to end up discarding half of the food purchased by the end of the week. 
                    This is a common pattern across the country, and about 80 million pounds of food is wasted each year. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Because of this, we decided to create a website that guides users in food waste prevention. 
                    There are similar apps on the market like TooGoodToGo. However, TooGoodToGo focuses on restaurant food waste, not household food waste.
